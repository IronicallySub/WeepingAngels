Note from Swirtzly
===========================
I have forked this mod recently (06/08/2018) as it was the first mod I played when I started playing Minecraft.
I personally never want to see the repo never drop off the face of the earth one day and have it unarchived.
I now work on and maintain a more up to date version of the mod based on what this mod here once was with newer models etc.
